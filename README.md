# Collection-of-Classic-image-recognition-models-in-Tensorflow
Collection of classic image recognition model based on deep learning, e.g.ResNet, Alexnet, VGG19, inception_V4 in Tensorflow. 

## Training networks
if you want to use Alexnet, you can use 

    python main.py ----type_of_model Alexnet

if you want to use VGG19, you can use 
   
    python main.py ----type_of_model VGG19

if you want to use inception_V4, you can use 
    
    python main.py ----type_of_model inception_V4
 
 if you want to use ResNet, you can use ResNet50 ResNet101 ResNet152

    python main.py ----type_of_model ResNet --resnet_type 50
